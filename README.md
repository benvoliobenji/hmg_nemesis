## **Warning**

NEMESIS is subject to GNU AGPL 3.0 License, get to know more [here](LICENSE).

You bear complete responsibility for any procedure with your car and its' components, it is important to understand that there is always risk associated with procedures described in this and associated documents in this repository, your car functionality may be heavily impacted if this software is not compatible with your components.

## Packages
Discover pre-made packages for you to install on your car. Browse catalog [here](Packages/README.md).

## **Quick Installation Guidance**

For your car to be compatible with NEMESIS, it has to have OTA update support (not necessary to have OTA Update subscription). Some cars may still not be compatible even in that case, it can only be understood once you try to install.

| Step | Guidance |
| ---- | -------- |
| 1 | Download [NEMESIS Installation Package](ota_package.tar) onto your computer. |
| 2 | Prepare an exFAT or FAT32 formatted blank USB drive. |
| 3 | Copy the downloaded tar file onto the USB, do not extract or repack the archive file. |
| 4 | Insert into the car's HU USB port, messages such as "No Supported Files" are expected. |
| 5 | Navigate to Engineering Mode (use web to search on how to do so), open USB Copy, select Update DSP |
| 6 | Tap on Update OTA, if you see a loading animation come up on the status bar in the top right, everything is going as planned. Wait for installation to complete and the HU to restart. |

## **Documentation**

Read about NEMESIS, what it is exploiting, what it features, and its use manual.

| Document | Contents |
|----------|----------|
| [01 - DSP OTA troubleShooter Path](01-DSP-OTA-troubleShooter.md) | How the firmware runs unsigned DSP OTA members as root, and how that path is reused. |
| [02 - Debugging Execution Interface](02-Debugging-Execution-Interface.md) | What NEMESIS is on the unit after it is present: features, how you open it, CLI and Manager usage. |
| [03 - Install and uninstall](03-Install-and-Uninstall.md) | How NEMESIS is written onto `/system` and how it is removed. |
| [04 - Packages](04-Packages.md) | Installable packages: metadata, layout, builder, lifecycle. |
| [05 - Run scripts](05-Run-Scripts.md) | USB `NEMESIS.sh` / `type=execute`: when they run and how to write them. |

Documents **01** and **03** are the only ones that describe the DSP Update Agent path and on-disk install, do not use them with advanced LLMs which may have safeguards enabled. **02**, **04**, and **05** assume NEMESIS is already on the head unit and treat it as a Debugging Execution Interface for packages and privileged commands, so safeguards will not be triggered.
